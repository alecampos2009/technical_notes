\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is a scalar
\item $\bold{f}$ is the column matrix with elements $f_i$ that correspond to the vector $\vec{f}$.
\item $\bold{f}$ is the square matrix with elements $f_{ij}$ that correspond to the tensor $\bar{\bar{f}}$.
\item Unit vectors are denoted as $\hat{f}$.
\item Upper case vs. lower case does not have any physical meaning, they are just used to extend the number of names available to label variables.
